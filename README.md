# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

Welcome to my capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Certificate course! 
In this case study, I will tackle many real-world tasks of a data analyst for a bike-share company based in Chicago in order to design marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.
I will analyze historical data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

The main tools I use are EXCEL, MySQL and Tableau. Here are the highlights:
* Tableau Dashboard: [Bike-Share Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jia.wang3280/viz/Bike-shareanalysis2022/Overview).
* Course: [Google Data Analytics Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone).


## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. 
I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**,
**share**, and **act**.

## Scenario
I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.



# **STEP 1 ASK – Understand the problem**
## 1.1  Defining the problem
The main problem for the director of the marketing and marketing analytics team is this: 
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic’s casual riders into annual members.\
There are three questions that will guide this future marketing program. 
1. **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
2. **Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?**
3. **How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?**

By looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain patterns that are occurring in the two different groups.
Understanding the differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted marketing for converting casual riders into members.
For the Cyclistic executive team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members and will fuel future growth for the company.

## 1.2 Business task
*	Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.
*	Analyze historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## 1.3 Identify key stakeholders
* The director of marketing who is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
* The Cyclistic executive team who is notoriously detail-oriented and will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
* The Cyclistic marketing analytics team which is a team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide marketing strategies.



# **STEP 2 PREPARE – What do we need ?**
## 2.1 Description of Data

## Data Source
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 which can be downloaded from [Cyclistic trip data](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).


## 2.2 Credibility of Data
The credibility and integrity of our data can be determined using the ROCCC system.
* The data is reliable — it has a large sample size, reflecting the population size.
* The data is original — we can locate the primary source.
* The data is comprehensive — it is understandable and does not contain any missing critical information needed to answer the question or find the solution, nor does it have human error.
* The data is current — it is relevant and up to date, thus indicating that the source refreshes its data regularly.
* The data is cited — the source has been vetted.

The data integrity and credibility are sufficient to provide reliable and comprehensive insights for the team's analysis.


# **STEP 3 PROCESS – From dirty to clean**


# **STEP 4 ANALYZE – Find the insights**


# **STEP 5 SHARE –  Visualizing findings**


# **STEP 6 ACT – Conclusions from the analysis**

## 6.1 Futher thinkings
* More bikes?
* More stations?
