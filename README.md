## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. 
I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. In order to
answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask**, **prepare**, **process**, **analyze**,
**share**, and **act**.

## Scenario
I am assuming to be a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations.



# STEP 1 ASK – Understand the Problem
## 1.1 Business task
*	Devise marketing strategies to convert casual riders to members.
*	Analyze historical bike trip data to identify trends in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## 1.2  Defining the problem
The main problem for the director of the marketing and marketing analytics team is this: 
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting Cyclistic’s casual riders into annual members.\
There are three questions that will guide this future marketing program. 
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

By looking at the data, we will be able to first get a broad sense of certain patterns that are occurring in the two different groups.
Understanding the differences will provide more accurate customer profiles for each group. These insights will help the marketing analytics team design high quality targeted marketing for converting casual riders into members.
For the Cyclistic executive team, these insights will help Cyclistic maximize the number of annual members and will fuel future growth for the company.
